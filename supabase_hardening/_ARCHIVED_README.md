# ARCHIVED - Staging Environment Documentation

**Status:** ðŸ“¦ Archived  
**Date Archived:** October 12, 2025  
**Reason:** Staging environment (mohctrsopquwoyfweadl) deleted - using git branching instead

## What This Was

This folder contains historical documentation for RLS hardening work that was performed on the now-deleted Connect-Staging Supabase project.

## What Happened to Staging

Connect-Staging was deleted to:
- Save $120/year during early development
- Simplify workflow (single production environment + git branches)
- Plan to recreate staging later when there are real paying users

## Is This Information Still Useful?

**YES** - The RLS policies and security hardening work documented here should be applied to production. The migrations and security fixes are valuable regardless of environment.

## How to Use This Documentation

1. The migrations in `migrations/` folder are applicable to **any** Supabase project
2. The security findings and RLS policies should be reviewed for production
3. The runbook and procedures are still relevant for future migrations

## Related Work

- All hardening was successfully applied to production (rxlqtyfhsocxnsnnnlwl)
- Security improvements are now live
- This is kept for historical reference and future security audits
