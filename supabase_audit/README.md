## 🎯 Quick Start

### For Executives/Managers
Read: **`overview.md`** (Section: Executive Summary)
- Overall health status
- Key metrics
- Critical findings
- Recommended next steps

### For Security Review
Read: **`rls_summary.md`**
- RLS coverage analysis
- Missing RLS tables
- Overly permissive policies
- Specific SQL recommendations

### For Developers
Review both documents + raw CSVs for:
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Index usage patterns
- Function security modes
- Trigger logic

---

## 🔍 How to Use This Audit

### 1. Read the Overview
Start with `overview.md` to understand:
- Project health status
- Connection patterns
- Auth configuration
- Storage setup
- Data integrity

### 2. Address Critical Findings
From `overview.md` and `rls_summary.md`:
- [ ] Enable RLS on `business_accounts` table
- [ ] Review and tighten RLS policies (currently too permissive)
- [ ] Verify storage bucket public access is intentional

### 3. Review CSV Data
Use spreadsheet software to:
- Sort/filter tables by size
- Analyze policy patterns
- Review function security modes
- Track connection usage

### 4. Plan Improvements
Create tickets for:
- RLS policy updates
- Performance optimizations
- Security hardening
- Monitoring setup

## 🚨 Critical Findings Summary

### 1. Missing RLS on `business_accounts`
**Risk:** HIGH  
**Impact:** All authenticated users can access/modify all business accounts  
**Action:** Enable RLS + create ownership-based policies  
**See:** `rls_summary.md` (Section: Security Concerns)

### 2. Overly Permissive RLS Policies
**Risk:** HIGH  
**Impact:** All users can read/modify all data across all tables  
**Action:** Implement row-level filtering based on ownership/participation  
**See:** `rls_summary.md` (Section: Policy Analysis)

### 3. Storage Public Access
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Anonymous users may access storage buckets  
**Action:** Verify this is intentional, adjust policies if needed  
**See:** `overview.md` (Section 9: Storage Buckets)

---

## ✅ Good Findings

1. **97% RLS Coverage** - Only 1 table missing RLS
2. **No Data Integrity Issues** - Zero orphaned records
3. **Healthy Connection Pool** - No bottlenecks or long queries
4. **Proper Realtime Setup** - FULL replica identity on chat tables
5. **Clean Data** - No duplicates in identity tables
6. **Good Indexing** - Appropriate indexes on high-traffic tables
