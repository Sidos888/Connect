## What Was Changed

### Database Changes (✅ Applied to Production)

1. **account_identities constraints:**
   - Added `UNIQUE(method, identifier)` - prevents duplicate emails/phones
   - Added `CHECK(phone format)` - validates E.164 format for phones
   - Phone numbers normalized to E.164 format (+61...)

2. **New Tables:**
   - `business_accounts` - supports up to 3 businesses per user
   - `rate_limits` - server-side rate limiting for OTP sends
   - `auth_audit_log` - audit trail for auth events

3. **RLS Policies:**
   - Fixed connections policies to use `current_session_accounts` view
   - Added business_accounts RLS policies (owner full control)
   - Fixed auth.uid() → account_id mapping

4. **New RPC Functions:**
   - `app_normalize_identifier` - normalizes emails/phones server-side
   - `app_can_send_otp` - checks rate limits before OTP send
   - `app_create_or_link_account` - atomic account creation/linking
   - `rl_allow` - rate limiting helper function

### Client Code Changes (✅ Applied)

1. **supabaseClient.ts:**
   - Removed fallback credentials (fail-fast on missing env vars)
   - Narrowed session cleanup to Supabase-specific keys only

2. **utils.ts:**
   - Added `normalizeEmail()` function
   - Added `normalizePhoneAU()` function

3. **authContext.tsx:**
   - Updated `sendEmailVerification` to normalize + check rate limit
   - Updated `sendPhoneVerification` to normalize + check rate limit
   - Updated `verifyEmailCode` to use atomic RPC
   - Updated `verifyPhoneCode` to use atomic RPC
   - Updated `createAccount` to use atomic RPC
   - Removed complex 5-strategy account loading (replaced with RPC)

## Deployment Steps (Production)

### Step 1: Database Migrations ✅ COMPLETE

```bash
# All migrations applied via Supabase MCP
# Migration list:
# - add_unique_method_identifier_constraint
# - create_business_accounts_table
# - create_rate_limits_table_and_function
# - create_auth_audit_log_table
# - fix_rls_policies_with_helper_view
# - remove_misleading_avatar_policies
# - create_app_normalize_identifier_function
# - create_app_can_send_otp_function
# - create_app_create_or_link_account_function
# - backfill_normalize_phone_numbers
# - add_phone_format_check_constraint
```

### Step 2: Verify Constraints ✅ COMPLETE

All existing phone numbers normalized successfully. CHECK constraint added.

### Step 3: Deploy Client Code ✅ COMPLETE

Client code updated to use new RPC functions.

### Step 4: Manual Testing (TODO)

Test the following flows:

**Email OTP Flow:**
1. Enter email in login modal
2. Verify OTP code sent
3. Enter 6-digit code
4. Verify account created/linked correctly
5. Verify rate limiting works (try sending 6 codes in 15 min)

**Phone OTP Flow:**
1. Enter phone (try formats: 0466310826, 466310826, +61466310826)
2. Verify OTP code sent
3. Enter 6-digit code
4. Verify account created/linked correctly
5. Verify phone normalized to +61... format

**Business Accounts:**
1. Create 3 business accounts
2. Attempt to create 4th - should fail with limit error
3. Delete one business
4. Verify can create another (back to 3 max)

**Duplicate Prevention:**
1. Sign up with email A
2. Sign out
3. Attempt to sign up with same email A
4. Verify links to existing account (no duplicate)

---

## Rollback Plan

### Option 1: Client Code Rollback (Preferred)

The migrations are **additive and safe** - no data loss. To rollback behavior without touching the database:

1. **Revert client code changes** in `authContext.tsx`:
   - Restore old `sendEmailVerification` (remove RPC rate limit check)
   - Restore old `verifyEmailCode` (remove RPC call, restore `checkExistingAccount`)
   - Restore old `createAccount` (restore optimistic local creation)

2. **Keep database changes** - the constraints and RPCs are beneficial even if not used yet

### Option 2: Full Rollback (Nuclear)

If critical issue requires complete rollback:

1. **Disable CHECK constraint** (allows old phone formats temporarily):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE account_identities DROP CONSTRAINT check_phone_format;
   ```

2. **Revert client code** (as above)

3. **Plan migration forward** - constraints should stay, fix client issues instead

### Feature Flag Approach (Recommended for Production)

Add environment variable `ENABLE_ATOMIC_AUTH_RPC=false` to disable new flows:

```typescript
// In authContext.tsx
const useAtomicRPC = process.env.ENABLE_ATOMIC_AUTH_RPC === 'true';

if (useAtomicRPC) {
  // New RPC-based flow
} else {
  // Old flow
}
```

## Monitoring & Verification

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **OTP Send Success Rate:** Should remain >95%
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE success = true) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate
   FROM auth_audit_log
   WHERE event_type = 'otp_send' 
   AND created_at > now() - interval '24 hours';
   ```

2. **Account Creation Success:** Should be 100%
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE success = true) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate
   FROM auth_audit_log
   WHERE event_type IN ('create_account', 'link_existing_account')
   AND created_at > now() - interval '24 hours';
   ```

3. **Rate Limit Rejections:** Should be rare (< 1%)
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM rate_limits 
   WHERE count >= 5 AND window_start > now() - interval '1 hour';
   ```

4. **Duplicate Identity Errors:** Should be 0
   ```sql
   -- Check for any UNIQUE constraint violations in logs
   -- Should see none after constraints applied
   ```

5. **Business Account Limit Errors:** Expected for users trying to create 4+
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM business_accounts 
   GROUP BY owner_account_id 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
   -- Should return 0 rows
   ```

### Verification SQL Queries

```sql
-- Check all constraints exist
SELECT conname, contype, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'account_identities'::regclass;

-- Expected constraints:
-- - unique_method_identifier (UNIQUE)
-- - check_phone_format (CHECK)

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Check RPC functions exist
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname LIKE 'app_%';

-- Expected functions:
-- - app_normalize_identifier
-- - app_can_send_otp
-- - app_create_or_link_account
-- - rl_allow

-- Check phone normalization
SELECT identifier, 
       CASE WHEN identifier ~ '^\+[1-9]\d{1,14}$' THEN 'VALID' ELSE 'INVALID' END as status
FROM account_identities
WHERE method = 'phone';
-- All should be VALID

-- Check audit log is working
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*), MAX(created_at) as last_event
FROM auth_audit_log
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY last_event DESC;

-- Check rate limits table
SELECT key, count, window_start
FROM rate_limits
WHERE window_start > now() - interval '1 hour'
ORDER BY window_start DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Check business accounts
SELECT owner_account_id, COUNT(*) as business_count
FROM business_accounts
GROUP BY owner_account_id
ORDER BY business_count DESC;
-- All counts should be <= 3
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: OTP Not Sending

**Symptoms:** User doesn't receive OTP code email/SMS

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if rate limited
SELECT * FROM rate_limits 
WHERE key LIKE 'otp:%' 
ORDER BY window_start DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check audit log
SELECT * FROM auth_audit_log 
WHERE event_type = 'otp_send' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check Supabase Auth logs in dashboard
2. Verify SMS provider configured (phone OTP only)
3. Check rate_limits table - may need to clear old entries
4. Verify email templates configured correctly

### Issue: "Account Already Exists" Error

**Symptoms:** User gets error saying account exists when trying to sign up

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Find conflicting identity
SELECT ai.*, a.name 
FROM account_identities ai
JOIN accounts a ON a.id = ai.account_id
WHERE identifier = 'USER_EMAIL_OR_PHONE';
```

**Solutions:**
1. This is correct behavior if identifier already claimed
2. User should use login instead of signup
3. If truly a duplicate, check audit log to see when identity was created
4. Edge case: If user has multiple auth_user_ids (shouldn't happen with new constraints)

### Issue: Phone Normalization Fails

**Symptoms:** User can't sign up with phone number

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Test normalization function
SELECT app_normalize_identifier('phone', '0466310826');
-- Should return: +61466310826

-- Check error in logs
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify phone is valid AU format
2. Check if non-AU number (current system only supports AU)
3. Look for special characters or formatting issues
4. Test with different formats: 04xxxx, 4xxxx, +614xxxx

### Issue: Business Account Limit Not Enforcing

**Symptoms:** User can create more than 3 businesses

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check trigger exists
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass, tgenabled 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trg_limit_business_accounts';

-- Check function exists
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'limit_business_accounts';

-- Count businesses per owner
SELECT owner_account_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM business_accounts 
GROUP BY owner_account_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify trigger is enabled
2. Re-create trigger if missing
3. Check for race conditions (multiple simultaneous creates)
4. Verify RLS policies are active

### Issue: Rate Limit Too Aggressive

**Symptoms:** Legitimate users blocked from sending OTP

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check rate limit entries
SELECT * FROM rate_limits 
WHERE window_start > now() - interval '1 hour'
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Solutions:**
1. Temporary: Clear rate_limits table for specific identifier
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM rate_limits WHERE key = 'otp:user@example.com';
   ```
2. Long-term: Adjust rate limit thresholds in `app_can_send_otp` function
   - Current: 5 OTP per 15min per identifier
   - Current: 30 OTP per 15min per IP
3. Consider adding whitelist for testing accounts

### Issue: Session Not Persisting on Mobile

**Symptoms:** User logged out after closing app

**Diagnosis:**
- Check Capacitor storage adapter logs
- Verify localStorage keys exist (sb-*, supabase.auth)

**Solutions:**
1. Mobile storage adapter configured correctly (already done)
2. Check iOS/Android app permissions
3. Verify PKCE flow enabled (already done)
4. Test on different mobile platforms

## Rollout to Production

### Pre-Production Checklist

- [ ] All STAGING tests passed
- [ ] No critical issues discovered
- [ ] Rate limits tuned based on usage
- [ ] Backup database before migration
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window (off-peak)
- [ ] Notify team of deployment

### Production Deployment Steps

1. **Schedule Maintenance Window**
   - Choose off-peak time (e.g., 2-4 AM local time)
   - Duration: ~30 minutes

2. **Backup Database**
   ```bash
   # Via Supabase dashboard or CLI
   # Or manual pg_dump
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations**
   - Run same SQL migrations as STAGING
   - In order: constraints → tables → functions → backfill

4. **Verify Migrations**
   - Run verification SQL queries (see Monitoring section)
   - Confirm no errors

5. **Deploy Client Code**
   - Deploy updated Next.js app
   - Verify build successful
   - Check app loads correctly

6. **Monitor for 24 Hours**
   - Watch OTP send rate
   - Watch account creation rate
   - Watch error logs
   - Watch rate limit rejections

7. **Enable Full Rollout**
   - If using feature flag, set `ENABLE_ATOMIC_AUTH_RPC=true`
   - Remove old code paths after 7 days of stability

### Production Rollback

If critical issue discovered:

1. **Immediate:** Revert client code (keep DB changes)
2. **Next steps:** Investigate issue, fix, re-deploy
3. **Never:** Don't rollback database constraints (safe & beneficial)
