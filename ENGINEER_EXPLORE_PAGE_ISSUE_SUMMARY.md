# Explore Page Content Missing - Summary for Engineer

## Current Status

The sign-out orchestration fix is working correctly: `signOut()` always resolves (fire-and-forget with timeout), `runSignOutFlow()` completes all steps (1-6), status updates work, and redirect to `/explore` executes. However, after redirecting using `window.location.replace('/explore')` (for reliability), the explore page module loads (`MODULE LOADED`, `MODULE COMPLETE` logs appear), AppShell renders children, but the explore page component function **never executes** (missing `FUNCTION CALLED` log that should appear when the component function runs). The page initially shows `childrenCount:1` but becomes `childrenCount:0` after auth state updates to `SIGNED_OUT`. This is a Next.js App Router static export + Capacitor hydration issue where full page reloads (`window.location.replace()`) prevent the component function from executing, even though the module loads. The explore page has execution-forcing code (`__explorePageShouldExecute` flag), but it's not working after full reload. We're currently using `window.location` for the final redirect in `runSignOutFlow()` (Step 6) for reliability, but this causes the hydration issue. The router is available via `navigationService.setRouter()` (set before sign-out), so we could use router-based navigation instead. Should we switch to router navigation for the final redirect, or is there another approach to ensure component execution after full reload in a static export + Capacitor environment? The goal is to have the explore page component execute and render content after sign-out redirect, showing the signed-out state with listings.
